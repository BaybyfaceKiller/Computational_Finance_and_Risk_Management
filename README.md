Projects related to portfolio optimization, risk modeling, asset pricing, etc. 
## Project 1: Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection Strategies
Test the performance of the portfolio using four different strategies:  
1. "Buy and hold" strategy
2. "Equally weighted" (also known as "1=n") portfolio strategy
3. "Minimum variance" portfolio strategy
4. "Maximum Sharpe ratio" portfolio strategy
## Project 2: Risk-Based and Robust Portfolio Selection Strategies
Test the performance of the portfolio using robust portfolio strategy and risk-based strategies
1. "Equal risk contributions" portfolio strategy
2. "Leveraged equal risk contributions" portfolio strategy
3. "Robust mean-variance optimization" portfolio strategy
## Project 3: Credit Risk Modeling and Simulation
The purpose of this project is to model a credit-risky portfolio of corporate bonds using the data for 100 counterparties, simulate 1-year losses for each corporate bond with 3 sets of scenarios:
1. Monte Carlo approximation 1: 5000 in-sample scenarios (N = 1000Â·5 = 5000 (1000 systemic
scenarios and 5 idiosyncratic scenarios for each systemic), non-Normal distribution of losses)
2. Monte Carlo approximation 2: 5000 in-sample scenarios (N = 5000 (5000 systemic scenarios
and 1 idiosyncratic scenario for each systemic), non-Normal distribution of losses)
3. True distribution: 100000 out-of-sample scenarios (N = 100000 (100000 systemic scenarios
and 1 idiosyncratic scenario for each systemic), non-Normal distribution of losses)
## Project 4: Asset Pricing
Obtain prices of the European option from Monte Carlo simulations
